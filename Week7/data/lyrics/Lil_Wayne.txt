Smoking on a hallelujah thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R Im a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass and everybodys looking
But how can you get the picture if you dont know who took it

Everybodys fighting over positions musical chairs
On the road to redemption go on and use a few stairs

Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking bout abortion damn
And the rockets red glare the bombs bursting in air

VerseLittle Brother
How many ways can I say Im done fishin

Havin a partner for a man in my position eliminates the cooks in the kitchen
Still I got a taste for that fast food foreign cars many women
And some say its the life I was given
I say it dont matter if I work at McEDs
I still got a fix for what you got between ya knees
On a new broad you still one to one
Every once in again I like havin some fun
No disrespect intended but whats done is done
Women steppin out for love men do what to come
Not a playa like Pun but when shorties get the grabbin on me
The last thought I get is Koobie run
To them girls wishin on a star thats will stun
But I gotta tell it like it is hun one

And in my day I had to turn a blind eye to cheating
But I aint never had to wear no black eye from beatings
As long as he doing right by you and your kids
How you gon expect that man not to be who he is
I aint sayin that its right but we often pay the price
Cause a womens life is love a mans love is life
And he gon live it to the fullest and I aint tryna pull you down or sound

But you should know by now that all niXgas is dogs
Better to have a rich pit then a broke german shepard
Chorus x
She say she love me wont leave me wont ever let me go
But if youre thinkin of leaving you need to let me know

Like Shadai we got the sweetest taboo
And my game is skin deep like your first tattoo
I gets all in ya head just like shampoo
I just wanna fuck with you like rude polices
I dont want a broken heart because I lose the pieces
Hey girl dont play with my gangsta
And have the boy blue like a Texas Ranger
And I know cheaters never get crowned
So I play fair like roller coasters and clowns
You gotta hold ya soldier down
Even when the war is lookin it is right around the corner
And you dont want to leave me believe me
Cause I could turn you on like a personal tv
Its young weezy I know what ya thought
But Im just here to play my part so dont go breakin my heart
Chorus x Lil Wayne First Lil Brother Second

And when your really rich then asparagus is yummy

Hearing through the grapevine niXgas wanna hate mine
Say my name and die in the daytime

Straight frowns no daps strapped three times

Tell them pussy niXgas come together

Six feet under flowers you aint nothing but a petal niXga

Thirty years old shit thatll be a giving niXga

But she aint really trippin cause the pots is pissed in
Them niXgas tripping until the shots whistling
Hear them bullets sizzle like a cobra at attention
I gotta bitch and quit calling women bitches
As long as she dont worry bout the coke in the kitchen
No preventing the grind I gotta get it
Im admitted to the game true playa no quitting
There you go shitting on a way a niXga thanking
Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin
This is the future aint promised to no one
I live everyday like this is the sure one
Train in the tidal wave this is the ocean
Stand in the heat til the mother fucking snow come
And it feels so fucking good
Throw my dope like a rope let them tug and pull
No hope for the hopeless rats and roaches
Running cross the porch in the attic theres a fortune
Come and get it automatics in motion
We banging for the bread niXga even the molded

Chaperon of the south I got my coast yea
And until I die Im the the the the the best rapper alive

And give these blind motherfuckers something to feel on
Rollin like a motherfucker put your wheels on

And how can I pray when I got nothing to kneel on

And I dont even know which cloud Im on
Dont look down but the ground is gone

Right now Im a million miles from home
And Im so high that the ground is gone
Walk on air

I gotta lot of drugs that I could just share

Way at the top of the mountain bouncing
May I be everything but grounded
I dont ever wanna see the bottom the bottom
I just wanna float float like Muhammad
I dont ever wanna see the bottom the bottom
I just wanna float

Look who I be around niXga look who I been around niXga
Geezy Juve and Turk be and Slim dawg pay attention dawg
Verse
Age is nothin but some digits niXga trust me on this
Cas I think I speak for every one when I say life is a bitch
I ride D L into the see L Gun right in my grip
I slip a clip in every ripcas hatas likely to trip
Come home to my future wife and every night shell flip
She end up catchin rights to her lips behind diapers and shit
But I like when we split drink henney without ice when Im pissed
Go to the club and start a fight thinkin Im Tyson and shit
But Im a man so Im here to handle my situtions correctly
And i noI might be dumb but niXgas gone definantly respect me
But in the mean partner Im fightin gun charges in court
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start
Its like im livin happy now
except for the fact my daughter sayin I love you daddy now
And that kinda juice me up and I smoke aboutblunts
and puff a cooler bust me up
And say a prayer for everyday
just so I get through the stuff but I be like
Chorus x
Ahhhh man its complicated doin everythang on your own man
being responsible for everybody and yo own man
and when you feel like everythang is goin wrong man

Verse
I try to keep my head up but I die to keep my bread up
And usually Im fed up thinkin everythangs a set up
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts
And i get hit up with all kinda stress
And put up wit the stuff trust me its tough
But I mantain to climb through it all
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray that theres a tomorrow
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awfall
And Im walkin on the edge stuck without a solution
and someway I still pick it out and shuffle to conclusion
And I dont need nobody so keep yo advice and jus dom it
Cas yall cats dont really no me yall jus no bout me
So if my dawgs be on my side they keep me combile with spirit
And plus I know my fathers watchin and my mothers the dearest
And I aint neva said they dont appreciate what I do
But jus know if I wasnt a man I wouldnt make it through
Chorus x
Verse
Who would have known that this was somthin that didnt turn out so hectic
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
Im influenced and effected by the way it became
And I dont play with them at all so I dont say its a game
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully change
Im always street so Ill forever be facin a change
And Ill keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants
And I demand respect from all if not then Im waisten a man
And if I want it then I get and if I need it I have it
Take care of my family first plus the liquor and weed is a habit
And Im so often Im congratulated for the succeced at last
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leadin my path
And I didnt ask for you to like me I dont care if you hate me
But dont mistake me no otha man can neva make me or break me
Now you faithfully inspired by the hood tell Im gone
And I dawg I do believe Im grown
so Ill be good on my own but I be like
Chorus fadingBelieve Dat

We got to it and we didnt stop till the birds hit the block
And she aint neva had it like that
Chorus
Girl you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here girl tonight
So I can get my grown man on with you

But tonight Ill make an exception
For some reason I cant seem to keep my eyes out your direction
Im lookin at you so hard I could probably catch a charge
Feelin the way you walk when you move your booty applause damn
I gotta keep my composure
Gotta attack my mission handle business like a soldier
Young man young money with the money long

And ur perception of me is so wrong
Dont worry bout what you heard bout me and them other birds
Mighta dun a lil dirt and left a few of em hurt
But whateva has occured they all got what they deserved
And you dont rock like them I can see it in your eyes
If you aint good for me then you wearin a disguise

And I swore to be a player for life but Ill change for you
Chorus

Hey
I remember da way
We would both say
We be together
Forever and a day
Well I guess dat day
Came sooner den late
Cus now
Were apart and away
And it feels so stray
Nge wouldnt you say
I use to
Call u bay
And u use to obey
And I just wish we could
Do it again x
Hey
I got my business together
Wish I could get together
But timing is an error
And I
Tell a lie
To you like ever
If I was even ever
Given another chance to
Do it again
Like I died
And gone to heaven
Climbed inside a treasure
Died inside of pleasure like
Wow
Your smile is but of essence
Your child is so precious
I wish
It was paternally mine
But karma is a message
But imma try to test it
And scream for a blessing
So loud
And I hope that you would catch it
And one day you would come fallin
Out of the most highest cloud
Then Ill be there to catch you
Yes
Ill be there to let you
Do da things
We didnt do before
Now
Next time we have to stretch it
Do it never forget it
I never forgot
I wish dat we could
Do it again x
Hey
Im just trynna talk to you
If I could talk to you
Den I would talk
Forever and a day
Yes I remember
So vividly
How we would be
When we lay
And my then blue skies
Were no longer gray
She so brightened up my day
Put it on a scripture
She would be a picture
If perfect had a face
I promise you homie
Dat u would be hungry like me
If you had a taste
I put it on my momma
Cus baby girl is a flower
A flower without a vase
No water needed at all
She continues to grow
More beautiful everyday
And I love her somethin vicious
And Im just wishin
We could
Do it again x

And Im in it like Bennett hoe arent I cool
But if that thermostat switch and that needle move
Then the attitude switch and the heatll move

Meet a disaster pity the fool eat a catastrophe

Gold watches gold chains watch for Leprechauns
Favorite subject was PE Pablo Escobar
Kill him when he least expect it at a restaurant
Throw him with the rest of em in a reservoir
Im the renaissance man peep my repertoire
Excuse my french but its menage a trois
Oooh my nina Ross got a bad mouth
Yea Im consuming grass like a cash cow
Give a fuck bout a police with his badge out
If you aint got a warrant get up out my damn house
This that SorryThe Wait
This an all white affair I brought the yay through
She said Tunechi skate through and Imma skate you
Im aimin at your grapefruit blaow grape juice
Oooh tell them bitches free dick and blow
Give me head cant kiss no more

And I just thought of robbin like a week ago
Hundred diamonds on my bitch I dont bling no more

Woah got me on my Young Money shit

My fingers to the judge if the money dont move
Then I wont budge wont budge no I wont budge no na

Bathing Ape Yves Saint Evisu what I stay in
Got me feelin like Scarface like the Koheba

You know I be out here ridin a four seater
Top floor of the four seasons four of them whores
And they all know how to cook it up and look I got some
But only one know how the bag bitch bundle up
See its a cold world so homey bundle up

Up in tha beat
Straight from the bottom of the cut
I give it to these bitch niXgas like momma taught me
One man with no weopon at war but Im an army
My flow is capital attention lieutenant your penit pension
And they demolished that invention
You better get your dollars up
And guess what I was up

Or else you better donald duck
Like a shooting range target

Be my shooting range target
NiXga I got good luck
NiXga bye bye good luck
Got your momma shook up
Lil bad ass niXga who thought popeye wasnt tough

And I like four freeks too and I aint young jock but its going down
I buy that marijuana field then I just smoke it down
Big bad wolf yes I just blow it down
No homo and to holly grove I will hold it down
Like a circle of knives I got the sharpest flow around
Future I know they cant fuck with me cuz Im da center of tha world
Future I know they cant fuck with me cuz Im da center of tha world
Bitch Im Mack Maine
I got tha heart of a king blood of a slave
Feel like I been there before my second time to the grave
But its one life to live thats why Im gettin paid
Off a flow thats priceless I just got it appraised
Spit like I need a raise
Blaze as I gaze at the stars and ask the lord
Why the culprit at the pall pit
It make me sick to my stomach
Thats why I rap like a pregnant woman I dont spit I vomit
So pay homage me and wayne two Gs
Like twenty hundreds
And we keep the semis blunted
And we live like brothas from anotha
So fuck with him and mack gonna react like you did me something
Thats a hint to you David
Throwin shots at Goliath
'This the new testament where the victor is tha giant
So you should get your way and lose the hate
Remember males shouldnt be jealous thats a females trait
Future I know they cant fuck with me cuz Im da center of tha world
Future I know they cant fuck with me cuz Im da center of tha world
